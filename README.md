## Welcome to DeepLearning Library by Rahul Mahanot

This DeepLearning Library is an open-source software library for numerical computation for Deep Neural Networks in Python. It was developed as a part of my personal hard-coded Deep Neural Network Programs in Python.
Started as a small initiative to learn the aspects of Deep Neural Nets, this library has since grown into a full-fledged collection of Programs that can be used to learn what actually happens inside the Deep and Deep layers of the Nets.

This library is just a collection of programs solicited for learning use only. If you wish to use the code for your personal commercial purposes, do remember to cite this library in your codes and do not forget to give a star. :)

### Markdown


This Library includes many parts. The latest week's (Week-6 and Week-7 as of now) is the one to be used for learning.
Week-6 is the hardcoded programs whereas Week-7 uses tensors and tensorflow DeepLearning Framework to do computations.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble or if you have any queries regarding this library, please drop a mail on [thecodeboxed@gmail.com](mailto:thecodeboxed@gmail.com) and Iâ€™ll help you sort it out.


Thank you!!
Have Fun (Deep)Learning. :)
